My name is Guru Prasad Singh and I am a professional data scientist, working for a big US-based firm. 

I have more than 5 years of experience in machine learning as well as deep learning.  I have extensively worked on Tensorflow, Pytorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and different NLP  and chatbot(RASA) framework.
I have also worked on Flask,  PySpark, Docker, Kubernetes, and GCP.

Most of the time you will find me experimenting with the code, however, I love to play video games mostly RPG one.  Apart from this, I also like to read classical Hindi novels and poetry.
